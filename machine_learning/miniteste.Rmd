## Explain how the k-nearest neighbourhood aproximates the Bayes classifier reasoning. Explain what are the assumptions and what are the potential risks of that kind of approximation



## Given a data sample, can we in general use Machine Learning to obtain the precise Bayes Optimal Decision Boundary? Provide a clear enough justification

Not precise, we get an approximation


## In a given well balanced binary classification problem, the sets of points corresponding to each of the 2 classes follow known distribution given by $P(X|k1)$ and $P(X|k2)$. How can we determine if a given point x belongs to class k1 or k2? Which points x are on the Optimal Bayes Decision Boundary?


$$c = min E(L(01)P(X|k1) + L(01)P(X|k2))$$
